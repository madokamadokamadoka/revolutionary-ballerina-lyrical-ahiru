## Writing Group Notes

This is a sort of a coming-of-age story about a naive and innocent
girl, her family, and the world. The world is fundamentally
broken. The family isn't broken *yet*. The girl... we shall see.

This story is imagined as an animated feature. (More plausibly, it
could be some sort of graphic novel.) We will refer to Episodes in
place of chapters, much like *Utena* calls each episode a 'Duel'.

Goals of Episode 1 include:

- establish the characters as a fundamentally happy and loving family
  who nevertheless have their differences, laying the groundwork for
  *fundamental rifts* to open between them in the future
- establish a few running jokes for ongoing use
    -  including some family jokes which, later, will not really work
       quite so well outside the family (an occasion for mild Feels)
- pay homage to a variety of important influences
    - permit over-informed readers to establish paranoid forecasts
      based on these

The text so far represents one of two parts of a planned Episode 1.
The second half involves a journey to the underworld.
