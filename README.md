## Writing Group Notes

The prompts for the week were something about death / dying, and Justice. You will no doubt see which of these I've addressed.

The material for this week's effort is in chapter / episode 1, the second half after the heading marked "Commercial Break," about page 9 in the PDF version. (Actually, this isn't the ideal spot for a commercial break, but it'll do as a heading for the moment.) For those who haven't read the first bit, you'll be oh-so-slightly missing out, but I've explained a few key things inline.

The entirety of what I have written for the group is there; however, in the rush to meet the deadline I fear there may be some trivial quirks so I may yet make last-minute formatting fixes, typo corrections, and the like in the morning. You can check the revision history to keep me honest. :D
